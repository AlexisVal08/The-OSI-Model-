<h1> The 7 Layers of the OSI Model</h1>
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model stands as a foundational framework for conceptualizing and standardizing the intricate processes involved in computer networking. Developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the OSI model divides the networking functions into seven distinct layers, each with a specific set of responsibilities. This layered approach ensures that the complexities of network communication are systematically addressed, promoting interoperability and modularity within the diverse world of computer networks.

<h2> The 7 layers of the OSI Model</h2>

<h2> Layer #1: Physical </h2>

![OSI Layer #1](https://github.com/AlexisVal08/The-OSI-Model-/assets/135868956/99d775d6-fe0e-406d-97f7-690b00fad7fe)

The Physical Layer serves as the foundation of the OSI model, dealing with the transmission and reception of raw binary data over the physical medium. It defines characteristics such as cables, connectors, and voltage levels, ensuring the accurate and reliable transfer of bits between devices. This layer is concerned with the actual hardware components, from cables and switches to the electrical impulses that represent the 0s and 1s of digital communication.
