<h1> The 7 Layers of the OSI Model</h1>
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model stands as a foundational framework for conceptualizing and standardizing the intricate processes involved in computer networking. Developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the OSI model divides the networking functions into seven distinct layers, each with a specific set of responsibilities. This layered approach ensures that the complexities of network communication are systematically addressed, promoting interoperability and modularity within the diverse world of computer networks.

<h2> The 7 layers of the OSI Model</h2>

<h2> Layer #1: Physical </h2>

![OSI Layer #1](https://github.com/AlexisVal08/The-OSI-Model-/assets/135868956/99d775d6-fe0e-406d-97f7-690b00fad7fe)

The Physical Layer serves as the foundation of the OSI model, dealing with the transmission and reception of raw binary data over the physical medium. It defines characteristics such as cables, connectors, and voltage levels, ensuring the accurate and reliable transfer of bits between devices. This layer is concerned with the actual hardware components, from cables and switches to the electrical impulses that represent the 0s and 1s of digital communication.

<h2> Layer #2: Data Link </h2>

Ascending to the Data Link Layer, a skilled choreographer emerges, framing data into coherent structures called frames. This layer excels in addressing, error detection, and correction, ensuring a flawless performance within the local network. The duet of Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC) sub-layers adds an intricate harmony, managing logical addressing and hardware addresses.

<br />

<h2> Layer #3: Network </h2>

![OSI Layer #1](https://github.com/AlexisVal08/The-OSI-Model-/assets/135868956/99d775d6-fe0e-406d-97f7-690b00fad7fe)

The Network Layer, the globe-trotter of the composition, takes center stage, orchestrating communication between devices on different networks. Armed with the Internet Protocol (IP), this layer assigns unique addresses and guides packets through routers, creating a seamless symphony of global connectivity.
</p>
<br />

<h2> Layer #4: Transport </h2>

![OSI Layer #1](https://github.com/AlexisVal08/The-OSI-Model-/assets/135868956/99d775d6-fe0e-406d-97f7-690b00fad7fe)

As the curtains rise higher, the Transport Layer assumes control, a virtuoso conductor ensuring reliable end-to-end communication. It segments and reassembles data, conducts flow control, and administers error detection and correction, with the dynamic duo of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) offering distinct cadences.
</p>
<br />

<h2> Layer #5: Session </h2>

![OSI Layer #1](https://github.com/AlexisVal08/The-OSI-Model-/assets/135868956/99d775d6-fe0e-406d-97f7-690b00fad7fe)

In the midst of this harmonious progression, the Session Layer steps forth as the maestro, establishing, managing, and concluding communication sessions between applications. It masterfully synchronizes the dialogue, allowing applications on different devices to exchange data in a beautifully choreographed performance.
</p>
<br />

<h2> Layer #6: Presentation </h2>

![OSI Layer #1](https://github.com/AlexisVal08/The-OSI-Model-/assets/135868956/99d775d6-fe0e-406d-97f7-690b00fad7fe)

The Presentation Layer, an artistic translator, bridges the realms between the application layer and the lower layers. It compresses, encrypts, and formats data, ensuring a coherent language that resonates seamlessly across diverse systems and applications.
</p>
<br />

<h2> Layer #7: Application </h2>

![OSI Layer #1](https://github.com/AlexisVal08/The-OSI-Model-/assets/135868956/99d775d6-fe0e-406d-97f7-690b00fad7fe)

Crowning this layered symphony, the Application Layer emerges as the virtuoso soloist, directly interacting with end-users and providing the pinnacle of network services. Protocols like HTTP, SMTP, and FTP are its instruments, delivering a captivating performance that facilitates the exchange of information and services.
